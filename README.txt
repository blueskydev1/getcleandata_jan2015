Project README

==================================================================
This README file is based on the README which accompanies the UCI HAR Dataset used as the course project source data. The full UCI HAR README is also excerpted for reference at the bottom of this document.

The script, run_analysis.r, assumes the UCI HAR Dataset has been placed in the R working directory subfolder entitled "data".

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone for 30 volunteers performing 6 activities. The UCI HAR Dataset consists of a number of nested folders containin main data and inertial detail data on 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity obtained from smartphone sensors. The original data may be found online at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This analysis script performs a number of operations on the UCI HAR dataset including consolidating all test and training data, including the Inertial data, into a single master dataset; adding descriptive activity and variable names; excerpting MEAN and STD data; and outputting these as a dataset summarized by Subject and Activity in a final txt file to the data directory. 

The final file is entitled "UCIHAR_finalAnalysisData.txt" and conforms to Tidy Data Principles as outlined in this course.

==================================================================
How The Script Works

A. Working on the Test Set
I.1 Creates and populates a variety of variables from the UCH HAR files.
II.1 Assembles the ACC, GYRO, and TOTAL inertial data into a single dataset.
II.2 Assembles the inertial and main data. Binds in the Activity, Features and Subjects.
II.3 Assembles the full Test data into a single dataset.

B. Working on the Training Set
I.1 Creates and populates a variety of variables from the UCH HAR files.
II.1 Assembles the ACC, GYRO, and TOTAL inertial data into a single dataset.
II.2 Assembles the inertial and main data. Binds in the Activity, Features and Subjects.
II.3 Assembles the full Training data into a single dataset.

C. Isolating the Means and Stds, Creating the Aggregate, Writing out the final results
1. Merges the full Test and full Training datasets.
2. Extracts MEAN and STD data.
3. Creates the summary data set of averages.
4. Performs write.file on the final file and exports it to a *.txt file in the data directory.

Feature Description - Excerpted from UCI HAR Dataset "features_info.txt".

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
